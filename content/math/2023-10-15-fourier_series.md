### heat equation {#heat-equation}

comes up as the application of fourier series

<https://chat.openai.com/share/40a33d10-fe55-4c57-8a08-3063bddf1d56>

heat (defusion) equation uses idea of

-   flow
-   conservation

Where the discrepance between amount of energy flow-in and flow-out should be equal to the energy stored inside the region.


### Black-Scholes equation {#black-scholes-equation}

<https://chat.openai.com/share/166b2c1c-670b-4ea8-a4ad-60e917d4ec1a>

asked if there's financial example of flow / conservation principle applied to finance,
and GPT answered Black-Scholes

It seems the connection is rather weak here though, you only get to interpret the flow / conservation in the equation after you set up the modeling.
Wheares in diffusion equation, the flow / conservation idea is used to setup the model.
